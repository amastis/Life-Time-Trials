# Life-Time-Trials
A spoof of Mario's Time Trials for taking action, using your device motion to stop the timer.


TODO [https://youtu.be/06MV79PPMEo?si=OBtLiPwMIarur2LO]
- calculate two bowls for gyro orientation -- and find out based on the current orientation which bowl to measure from
- find the angular acceleration based on device motion to simulate standing motion instead of a hand movement from side to side
